                <p>Greetings, my name is Danish Adam bin Idham, and I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for building creative and impactful solutions. I was born on the 28th of September 2004 and currently live in Gombak, Selangor. I enjoy exploring new technologies and continuously improving my skills in the digital world.</p>
                <p>At present, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering with Honours at Universiti Putra Malaysia, located in Serdang, Selangor. This program has deepened my interest in software development, especially in areas like web design and system architecture. I’m always excited to take on new challenges and expand my technical knowledge.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my first HTML website. This project is a small but meaningful step in my journey as a future developer. I’m eager to continue learning, especially in web development, and can't wait to create even more exciting projects ahead.</p>
